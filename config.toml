#### Not a penny more, not a penny less

We build software for your needs, which is often different from what you initially want. We work with you to transform "want" into "need" into "working software".

#### Honesty and integrity matters

We appreciate you chose to work with us - we work very hard to ensure quality, honesty, transparency and clarity.

#### Talk is cheap, show me the code

We assure that measurable progress is being delivered to you starting day 1.

#### The only constant is change

We know and respect this and work with you to let the software evolve.
